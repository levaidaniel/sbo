# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libzrtpcpp2: libzrtpcpp2 (ZRTP support for ccRTP)
libzrtpcpp2:
libzrtpcpp2: This package provides a library that adds ZRTP support to the GNU
libzrtpcpp2: ccRTP stack. Phil Zimmermann developed ZRTP to allow ad-hoc, easy
libzrtpcpp2: to use key negotiation to setup Secure RTP (SRTP) sessions. GNU
libzrtpcpp2: ZRTP works together with GNU ccRTP (1.5.0 or later) and provides a
libzrtpcpp2: ZRTP implementation that can be directly embedded into client and
libzrtpcpp2: server applications.
