MultiSSH is a GTK+ based SSH client originally developed by Bradley Smith. It's
designed to connect to multiple servers and issue the same commands to each
server, making administering multiple servers less of a chore. There is also
functionality to only issue commands to individual servers, and to select a
portion of the servers to send commands to.
