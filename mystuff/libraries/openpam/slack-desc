# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

openpam: openpam (open source PAM library)
openpam:
openpam: OpenPAM is an open source PAM library that focuses on simplicity,
openpam: correctness, and cleanliness. Its aim is to gather the best features
openpam: of Solaris PAM, XSSO and Linux-PAM, plus some innovations of its own.
openpam: In areas where these implementations disagree, OpenPAM tries to remain
openpam: compatible with Solaris, at the expense of XSSO conformance and
openpam: Linux-PAM compatibility.
