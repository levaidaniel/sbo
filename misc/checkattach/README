When using mutt as your mail user agent, you can specify which files to attach
using the pseudo header :Attach. This only works when edit_headers is set in
your .muttrc configuration file. See the mutt manual for further information
about that topic.

This plugin checks, whether certain keywords exist in your mail, and if found,
you'll be asked to attach the files. This is done to prevent that you sent
mails in which you announce to attach some files but actually forget to attach
the files so that your have to write a second mail which often is quite
embarassing.
