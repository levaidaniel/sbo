# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Test-LeakTrace: perl-Test-LeakTrace (traces memory leaks)
perl-Test-LeakTrace:
perl-Test-LeakTrace: Test::LeakTrace provides several functions that trace memory leaks.
perl-Test-LeakTrace: This module scans arenas, the memory allocation system, so it can
perl-Test-LeakTrace: detect any leaked SVs in given blocks. Leaked SVs are SVs which are
perl-Test-LeakTrace: not released after the end of the scope they have been created. These
perl-Test-LeakTrace: SVs include global variables and internal caches. For example, if you
perl-Test-LeakTrace: call a method in a tracing block, perl might prepare a cache for the
perl-Test-LeakTrace: method. Thus, to trace true leaks, no_leaks_ok() and leaks_cmp_ok()
perl-Test-LeakTrace: executes a block more than once.
