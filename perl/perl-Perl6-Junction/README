This is a lightweight module which provides 'Junction' operators, the most
commonly used being any and all.

Inspired by the Perl6 design docs,
http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/design/exe/E06.html.

Provides a limited subset of the functionality of Quantum::Superpositions, see
"SEE ALSO" for comment.

Notice in the "SYNOPSIS" above, that if you want to match against a regular
expression, you must use == or !=. Not =~ or !~. You must also use a regex
object, such as qr/\d/, not a plain regex such as /\d/.
