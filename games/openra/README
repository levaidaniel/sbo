OpenRA is a Libre/Free Real Time Strategy project that recreates the classic
Command & Conquer titles.

We include recreations of C&C (Tiberian Dawn), C&C: Red Alert, and Dune 2000.
These are not intended to be perfect copies, but instead combine the classic
gameplay of the originals with modern improvements such as unit veterancy and
the fog of war.

OpenRA's primary focus is cross-platform multiplayer between Windows, OS X, and
Linux; however, we include a number of single-player missions, and also support
skirmish games against AI bots.

This slackbuild just repackages the precompiled binaries in the .deb package
file.
