The JayDeBeApi module allows you to connect from Python code to databases
using Java JDBC. It provides a Python DB-API v2.0 to that database.

It works on ordinary Python (cPython) using the JPype Java integration or on
Jython to make use of the Java JDBC driver.

In contrast to zxJDBC from the Jython project JayDeBeApi let’s you access a
database with Jython AND Python with only minor code modifications.
JayDeBeApi’s future goal is to provide a unique and fast interface to
different types of JDBC-Drivers through a flexible plug-in mechanism.
