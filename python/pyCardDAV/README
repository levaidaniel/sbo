pyCardDAV is a simple to use CardDAV CLI client. It has built in support for
mutt's query_command but also works very well solo (and with other MUAs).

pyCardDAV consists of pycardsyncer, a program for syncing your CardDAV
resource into a local database and of pc_query, a program for querying the
local database. pyCardDAV is some ugly python code (actually, it's not that
bad anymore...) that holds together vobject, lxml, requests and pysqlite.
