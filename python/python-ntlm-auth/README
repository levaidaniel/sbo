This library handles the low-level details of NTLM authentication for use in
authenticating with a service that uses NTLM. It will create and parse the 3
different message types in the order required and produce a base64 encoded
value that can be attached to the HTTP header.

The goal of this library is to offer full NTLM support including signing and
sealing of messages as well as supporting MIC for message integrity and the
ability to customise and set limits on the messages sent. Please see Features
and Backlog for a list of what is and is not currently supported.
