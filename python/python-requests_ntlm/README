This package allows for HTTP NTLM authentication using the requests library.

HttpNtlmAuth can be used in conjunction with a Session in order to make use of
connection pooling. Since NTLM authenticates connections, this is more
efficient. Otherwise, each request will go through a new NTLM
challenge-response.
